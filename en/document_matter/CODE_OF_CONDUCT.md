### Mission Statement:

The mission of the SAFETAG community is to improve the security of civil society organizations around the world.

What we do: The community collaborates actively to share knowledge, build capacity, and create resources, while promoting transparency and accountability amongst its members, as well as with other communities of practice.

### Community Standards

The SAFETAG Community of Practice (SCoP) exists in both public and private groups, currently including a public Slack channel, the Internet Freedom Festival Mattermost, and the orgsec.community listserv.

* Community members are encouraged to be active - positively contributing / leading discussions on community channels, creating, curating, or peer-reviewing content or contributing to the issue queue. 
* Some SCoP members may have privacy concerns, and should join the community using a pseudonym they are comfortable with engaging online in both public and private spaces with.
* Joining the community: Directions for joining the SAFETAG Slack can be found on https://www.safetag.org; for joining the Internet Freedom Mattermost can be found at https://internetfreedomfestival.org/wiki/index.php/IFF_Mattermost.
* The SCoP is responsible for adhering to the SAFETAG Code of Conduct, below

#### SAFETAG Code of Conduct

Members of the SAFETAG community are expected to:

* Respect the auditees, their contexts (including the legal framework they operate within), and protect their privacy and security
* Protect the identifying information and audit findings of your auditees, unless you have full, informed consent of the auditee -- and even then, exercise extreme care.
* Never use your knowledge, skills and/or access to do harm against organizations or communities you are working with or your peer auditors through malice or neglect
* Minimize any conflict of interests through transparency in your contracting, reporting, and recommendations; e.g. if you were not hired initially to implement recommendations, suggest options other than yourself for implementation, and provide reporting that would enable that to be a success in every case.
* Perform your job responsibly and well. Ask and consult with fellow members of the community.
* Respect other members of the community as peers and promote a safe, inclusive, and harassment-free environment

### Code of Conduct Violations

* Serious or repeated violations of the Code of Conduct may lead to removal from one or all community platforms.
* To report a violation, please reach out privately to an administrative user of the relevant platform or email info at safetag.org
