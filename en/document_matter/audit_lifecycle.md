## The Life Cycle of an Audit

SAFETAG consists of a collection of high-level Methodologies, each with a variety of linked activities, that contribute towards the goals and their required information needs is represented here. Activites tend to fall in three broad approaches: Technical, Research, and Interpersonal. It is tempting to focus on the style of approach you as the auditor are most comfortable with - people with backgrounds in digital security training tend towards the interpersonal, people with pentesting backgrounds the technical. However, by using a combination of these, you get a clearer understanding of not only the organizationâ€™s setup and infrastructure, but how decisions are made, how policies are enforced (or not), and where there are opportunities for organizational change. Experienced Auditors will likely come up with their own approaches, and the SAFETAG project welcomes such contributions.  

The audit process in very cyclical. Assessment activities reveal new threats, vulnerabilities, capabilities, and barriers which in turn shed new activities that have already been and have yet to be run. At the same time the auditor, through conversations, training, and group activities is actively building the organization's agency and addressing time-sensitive or critical threats insofar as possible within the time frame. This iterative process eventually leads to a point where the auditor is confident they have identified the critical and low-hanging fruit, and is confident the organization is capable of moving forward with their recommendations.

Each objective requires a certain base of information, and outputs more information into this cyclical process.  Each objective has a "map" of the data flow that it and its specific activities provide:

* **Actors** Actors are the people connected to an organization including an organization's staff, board members, contractors, and partners.  Actors could also include volunteers, members of a broader community of practice, and even the family members of principle actors. Actors also include potential adversaries of the organization such as competing groups.
* **Activities** Activities are the actions and processes of an organization.  While most NGO work revolves around program-based concepts, activities also include things like payroll.
* **Capacity** Indicators of capacity include staff skills and a wide variety of resources that an organization can draw from to affect change including funding, networks, and institutional processes and policies.
* **Barriers** Barriers are specific challenges an organization faces that might limit or block its capacity.
* **Assets** Assets are most easily conceptualized as computer systems - laptops and servers, but also include both the data stored on them and can also be services like remote file storage, hosted websites, applications, webmail, and more.  Offline drives, USB sticks, and even paper records containing sensitive information are also assets.
* **Vulnerabilities** Vulnerabilities are specific flaws or attributes of an asset susceptible to attack.
* **Threats** A threat is a specific, possible attack or occurrence that could harm the organization.

If a bucket of oily rags is a **vulnerability**, a fire is the **threat**.  **Mitigations** would be rules against leaving oily rags around as well as fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, remote backup policies, and evacuation planning. Note that some mitigations may be outside the **capacity** of an organization -- perhaps there is limited budget (a **barrier**)  for one fire extinguisher or one smoke detector, but not both.  The auditor will need to work with the organization to review **asets** (can assets at higher risk from smoke or fire damage be protected in other ways), **activities**, and **actors** as well as a detailed review of the **threats** to determine the organization's response.

These components are defined in greater depth in the Risk Assessment and Agency Building sections to follow.
