### Why It Matters

The audit findings will be the most risky information that you and the organization will possess.  Communications and reports containing audit findings
spell out the organization's presumed adversaries, threats, their most important processes, actionable vulnerabilities, and the risks they open up.

In other words, this document is as easily a guide to how to do the maximum damage to the organization as it is a roadmap to prevent the same. Protection of this information is therefore of the utmost importance.

In addition, some country contexts present risks for you and the organization throughout periods of travel and the audit process itself.
