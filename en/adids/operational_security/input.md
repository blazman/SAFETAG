### Input

Present (eg. slides or group discussion and activities) on the following content:

**Operational Security Basics**

Operational security is mandatory, not optional  -- don't be the weak link

**Evidence Handling**

Refer to the Advanced Threats Methodology for minimal evidence handling approaches and to review initial triage steps for auditors with varying skill levels.

**Opsec and Secure Communications Process**

It is crucial to work with the organization to settle on a secure communication protocol that is both responsible to their potential threats (as identified by the context research) and usable. If the process is alienating or too difficult members of the organization will "circumvent" it. You need to do a basic assessment of their capabilities and then base the level of operational security on that.
