### Input

Provide instruction and classroom inputs (eg. slides, group discussion) on the following:

#### Intro to SAFETAG

  * What is SAFETAG
    * The [TRI approach](https://safetag.org/2018/08/16/SAFETAGStories-dropbox.html)
  * Why audits?
  * What SAFETAG isn’t:
    * Pen testing
    * Digital Security Training
    * Hands-on fixing (why?)

#### Risk Assessments, vulnerability assessments, and pentesting: an overview

  * The core of the audit (risk modeling)
  * Traditional Vulnerability Assessments
  * Traditional Risk assessments
  * Using pentesting
    * The perils of pen testing
    * The possibilities of pen testing

#### Overview of Framework and process

  * The Scope of a SAFETAG Audit
  * How the components merge into each other
  * The importance of adaptation - SAFETAG is not a monolithic, do-everything-in-an-exact order process.  By nature each organization will be different, and SAFETAG is intended to provide an organized toolbox of different activities to achieve a goal of a comprehensive risk assessment of the organization's digital security approach.
  * The training will follow a more structured process and highlight activities to work through the material, build and assess critical skills, and show a range of different approaches to SAFETAG assessments; but auditors should not feel constrained to follow this specific flow and indeed are encouraged to create their own "favorites" and approaches, or create new ones to share with the community.

  Present and discuss the SAFETAG audit process image below:

##### Goals

  * We are trying to find the best leverage points to build a risk assessment out of the “top” vulnerabilities identified for a quick impactful audit.
  * This creates strong buy-in and deeper understanding of how technology interacts with their security needs


##### Responsibilities

Auditors have access to a wealth of sensitive information and unusual access to organizational leadership. Auditors, the organizations they work with, and funders have important responsibilities to each other.

Responsibility of the auditor to the organization

  * Responsible handling of sensitive data (operational security)
  * Providing an accurate and timely report
  * Supporting realization of positive outcomes
  * Engaging in on-going conversation
  * Connecting organizations to resources

Responsibilities of funders/project implementers for auditors and organizations

  * Respecting privacy: don’t share organizational risk data with funder
  * support for auditors when you are doing audits (financial, communication, security preparedness and responsiveness)

Responsibilities of the Auditors to the SAFETAG community

  * Customizing SAFETAG to fit an organization’s needs and your skills
  * Select the right tools for the job
  * Join the SAFETAG community and provide feedback on the process and contribute to the resource for other auditors
