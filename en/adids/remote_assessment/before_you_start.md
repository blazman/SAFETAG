### Before You Start

* Trainers should prepare to give suggestions for specific targets (who are public and/or willing) for this activity, and strongly discourage accidental "doxing" of the participants.
* Refresh your familiarity with any tools/services you intend to use, ensure you have any API keys or login credentials you will need before the training.
