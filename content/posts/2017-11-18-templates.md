Thanks to some feedback, we've updated the contribution guide at [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/blob/master/en/document_matter/CONTRIBUTING.md) with clearer, step-by-step guides, a reminder to post an issue to the [issue queue](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/issues) first, and - most usefully - templates to use to get started crafting new SAFETAG methods and activities.  Those can be found in the [templates folder](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/tree/master/en/templates).
