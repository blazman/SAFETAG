Last month, we shared that we would be updating the visual identity of SAFETAG, including the development of a new logo, color-scheme, and iconography. We are excited to share that we  will be working with [*Tafka*](https://showcase.dropbox.com/s/This-is-tafka-MX9NBtr2zTzngWhO2EVLp), a design collective based in Mexico, and are officially starting the re-design process!

## Why re-design SAFETAG?

We have decided to re-design SAFETAG to provide a more cohesive and recognizable brand. The new digital assets will be used across the website, interface (more details below), and all other SAFETAG documentation. Our hope is that this new design will make content more accessible for users, particularly new auditors that may have previously struggled with navigating through the framework.

## New Interface (coming soon)

In addition to the re-design, we are working with a development team to build a new SAFETAG interface that is easier to use and more accessible for both new and experienced auditors. The new interface will allow auditors to generate “playlists,” or collections of audit activities, tailored to a specific type of organization or risk environment. These customized and shareable playlists can be stored for future reference or shared with other auditors working in similar contexts. We are expecting to launch the new interface during the late summer or early fall of 2020.

## We need you!

In order to make sure that the new design reflects the needs of the SAFETAG community, we would like to invite all SAFETAG users, both new and experienced, to share feedback with us. We will be holding **two open community calls** on **May 19, 2020 at 10:30 am ET and another on May 21 at 9:00 am ET.** Please let us know you will be attending one of the calls by registering [*here*](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbcQm-IR0tUdC32T1dzRNxgEa_oAfMk9gNlcyNvkoTHgsTRw/viewform). We will be sharing details for joining the call directly via email with those who RSVP.

In addition to the community feedback calls, we would also like to invite community members to complete a **[*short survey*](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_4r7JM8YDEj17h-IgPgXOM0PS2BGyMek1JLyW0wKHyBkAFQ/viewform).** This 20-question survey will allow us to collect any ideas and feedback you may have and provide space for those who may not be able to join one of the community feedback calls to share thoughts asynchronously. We look forward to hearing from you and incorporating your thoughts and feedback into this design process!
