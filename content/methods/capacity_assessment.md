  * You may be interacting with many staff members. Avoid reporting the comments
  from other staff members to their peers or supervisors unless you clarify that
  this is agreeable with the source of the information.

  * Consider the security of your modes of communication if carrying out interviews remotely. Remember that your interviewees may be connecting from devices of unknown security status.

  * Follow a plan when taking notes - as physical notes can be a risk in case they are seized and digital notes need to be consolidated in a secure location.

purpose: >
  Knowing an organization's strengths and weaknesses allows the auditor to
  provide more tailored recommendations that an organization will be more likely
  to attempt and achieve. The auditor will use this assessment in preparing for
  the audit itself as well as when evaluating the difficulty of a
  recommendation. This information also provides a starting place for
  understanding the organization's current use and understanding of technology,
  digital security, and current threat landscape, as well as revealing elements
  of an organization's workflow, infrastructure and even vulnerabilities that
  you might otherwise have overlooked.
preparation: |

  * Review or create a set of interview questions to keep you on track
  * Have a secure note-taking process ready
