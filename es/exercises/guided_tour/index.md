##### Summary

The physical assessment methodology is focused on how to mitigate against threats that occur because of the arrangement of digital assets in the physical world. 

The assessment uses a walkthrough and interview methodology to answer the following questions:

  * How are daily devices used and stored?
  * Where are they when employees go home?
  * Are there active network jacks that are unused, are they in public spaces, are they in places where people would not notice if there was somthing plugged into them?
  * How are backups managed? Where are they stored?
  * Where are the servers and network components that host and manage the organizations assets?
  * Who has independent access to the office space?

##### Overview

* Have your point of contact walk you around the office (often as part of introductions on the first day) - mentally note physical security concerns.
* Discuss access policies

##### Materials Needed 

* A notepad may be useful

##### Considerations


##### Walkthrough

**Step 1 : Guided Tour**

As part of your first day, have your point of contact walk you around the office - this is primarily a chance to understand the office layout and meet the rest of the staff, but take mental note of the devices in use and laying out on desks as you walk around the office.  Note as well the location and access to components such as servers and networking components.

  * Device usage and storage,
  * Sensitive information or external storage drives lying on desks,
  * Accounts/passwords written on post-its, white-boards, etc.,
  * Unattended, logged in computers,
  * Unlocked cabinets, computer rooms, or wiring closets.

Taking actual notes may make the staff feel that you are judging them, so refrain from this if possible, especially if this is your first interaction.

**Step 2 : Access Policies**

Working with your POC and other relevant staff (administrative/operational staff, IT staff), enumerate list of everyone who has independent access to the office space, and routine after-hours access (i.e. who is able to unlock the space).  This may include cleaning or other service personnel.  Shared office spaces present unique challenges, and access policies and procedures for the building housing the office may also become relevant.

**Step 3 : (Optional) After Ours Walk-Through**

Also schedule a time with your primary point of contact to visit the office when all (or at least most) staff are not present.  This could be before the staff arrives in the morning, or after hours (perhaps have dinner with your POC, and come back to check the organization afterwards). Other significantly less ideal options could be during a lunch break or a meeting when the staff are offsite or in a conference room.

During this time, go back through the office (taking notes for the audit this time) to see how devices are outside of the work day (are desktops and laptops unsecured, still on, logged in?).  Are backup drives or other storage media easily accessible? Are doors to server rooms/closets locked?  Are keys to these locked cabinets/rooms visible?

Also note and test network ports that are not in use, looking especially for ones which are not in plain sight.

##### Recommendation
**Office Equipment is unsecured against burglary**

Unsecured physical network components and devices such as computers, servers, and external drives present a risk of sensitive data loss through theft, seizure, and malicious interference. Access to network compontents and servers should be limited and devices should be secured when not in use.

In the event of a burglary or office raid, an attacker could easily obtain sensitive information from devices without encryption, external hard drives, and other easily accessible items.  An advanced attacker could compromise the network for later surveillance.  

**Secure Devices**

_Lock in desks or via security cables all easily portable items_

Any device which connects to the organization's digital assets (and therefore has passwords or cached data) or stores organizational data (including backup drives, laptops, desktops, cameras, other storage media), should be secured (ideally out of sight, such as in a locked cabinet or desk drawer) when not in use to prevent theft and discourage seizure.

_Follow the Device Assessment guidelines on drive encryption._

Encrypted drives offer the best protection against data loss from stolen or seized devices. Follow the recommendations of the Device Assessment section, paying specific attention to the need for strong passwords, automatic locking of logged-in accounts, and the importance of turning a machine off to fully benefit from drive encryption.

_Place core network components and servers in a locked space._

Direct access to servers and network components such as routers, cablemodems, patch panels and switches provides an adversary multiple ways to extract sensitive information and cause extensive, yet hard to detect, damage. Ensuring that not only are these physically protected, but that there are organizational policies around which staff have access to them is critical - a locked cabinet that always has the key in the lock does not provide security. If a particular component needs, for example, regular rebooting, creative solutions should be found to balance security and staff needs.

_De-activate unused network ports_

Hard-wired network ports tend to connect directly into the most trusted parts of a network.  De-activating any that are in public areas of the office (front desk, conference rooms, break rooms), as well as any that are not needed is recommended.
