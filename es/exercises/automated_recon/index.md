    * Search "paste-bin" sites for leaked internal information or existing exploitation of their infrastructure.
    * Create API keys for Recon-ng services to be used. [^recon-ng_API_keys]
    * Use recon-ng to do automated web-based open source reconnaissance. [^recon-ng_data_flow]
  


##### Materials Needed 

##### Considerations

  * Use VPNs to do automated searching. The automated process can be misconstrued by various services as malicious and cause your local network to get blocked, filtered, or surveilled. Tor is often blocked by the tools you will be using.
