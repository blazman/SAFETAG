Effective strategies include finding digital security champions within organizations and building capacity in the surrounding community. Building the confidence and ability of those in the organizations to put digital security into practice is just as important as hardening their digital security.</li>\n<li><strong>Organizational Security assistance is not being made available to those who need it the most.</strong> In the US and globally marginalized communities facing the greatest threats are also those with least access to critical digital security resources (both human and financial). It is imperative to address this fact when designing programs and change the language we are using to be more inclusive of these communities.</li>\n<li><strong>A security audit or assessment is just the beginning!</strong> Most organizations need long-term support to make an effective change in their practices and harden their defenses against digital security attacks. Despite this, funding structures supporting current OrgSec work are not conducive to long-term engagement. Practitioners need to consider how to bake sustainability and long-term support into program design.</li>\n</ul></section>\n<section><h3 id=\"its-not-too-late-to-register\">Itâ€™s not too late to register!</h3><p><strong>Join us for more sessions throughout the week on OrgSec in Practice, Advanced Threats, Funding Models, and more!</strong></p><p>Register at: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_vzeIABKyYt1pMiq4_Ka-Ffk8kcjGmHnJQw9-n2UCfjAbig/viewform\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd<em>vzeIABKyYt1pMiq4</em>Ka-Ffk8kcjGmHnJQw9-n2UCfjAbig/viewform</a></p><div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"/img/blog/IFFOSV_Title.svg\" alt=\"Five OrgSec Village Themes are 1.
