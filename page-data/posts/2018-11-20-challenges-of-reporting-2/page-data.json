This\nusually leads to specify well which tools or indicators were used,\nmaking it a nice input for IT staff and consultants linked with the\norganization.</p><section><h3 id=\"pros-2\">Pros</h3><ul>\n<li>Allows us to build the report faster because we can feed this kind of report as a log during the process</li>\n<li>Could be intuitive for technical audiences. Useful when the organization have IT staff and they are the most involved part during the assessment. With this format is easier for them to reproduce the results</li>\n<li>If we want to do more activities during the process is more intuitive to add the new information to the report</li>\n<li>The report is easy to feed by more than one people running the assessment.</li>\n</ul></section><section><h3 id=\"cons-2\">Cons</h3><ul>\n<li>Generally not the most intuitive format for the organizations given that they could not be familiar with our activities/tools</li>\n<li>Depending on the structure and detail level could be challenging communicating technical things causing the organization to dismiss recommendations just for not understanding them</li>\n<li>Could be difficult to organize visually activities vs. assets vs. risk associated vs. implementation terms</li>\n<li>It doesn’t work as well for assessments that go beyond the more specific technical aspects -- it is hard to bring in higher level (policy, practice) problems which do not cleanly “fit” in any one activity.</li>\n</ul></section></section>\n<section><h2 id=\"4-the-super-comprehensive-and-sometimes-dangerously-long-risk-oriented-report\">4: The super comprehensive (and sometimes dangerously long) risk oriented report</h2><p><img src=\"/img/blog/challengesreporting/image4.png\"></p><p>This approach without doubt is the more complete on this article, it\naims to catalogue and develop 4 types of information:</p><ol>\n<li><strong>Threats:</strong> coming principally from the threat modelling activity</li>\n<li><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong> discovered during the execution of the assessment activities</li>\n<li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> developed to respond to the vulnerabilities discovered</li>\n<li><strong>Implementation plan:</strong> ordering the recommendations in a way that makes sense for the organization</li>\n</ol><p>We can have better results with this approach when we can link the\nvulnerabilities with the associated threats and with the correspondent\nrecommendations, so if we are reading a recommendation we can know what\nvulnerabilities and threats it tries to address. Giving the reader the\nmost important answers she/he needs.</p><p>Given the complexity of this approach is crucial to select a structure\nand format that makes easy to the reader reach the information he/she\nwants to get without distracting with noise, this could be particularly\nchallenging when using formats like PDFs or odt/docx.</p><section><h3 id=\"pros-3\">Pros</h3><ul>\n<li>Usually everything you want to know about the assessment is on the report, facilitating the understanding of the organization especially when in the future it will be more difficult to contact us</li>\n<li>Guarantees that the assessors are linking suggestions to identified threats and organizational priorities</li>\n<li>It links directly the group exercise made during the assessment with the recommendations, making it easier for the organization to understand the pertinence of them</li>\n<li>Follows an ordered process, leading an open door to automation (spoiler: working on that :wink: )</li>\n<li>It helps the organization to keep an eye on the evolution of their threat model while implementing the recommendations, making the organization an active part in the process of follow-up and opens a door to do a better Monitoring and Evaluation of the security implementation process</li>\n</ul></section><section><h3 id=\"cons-3\">Cons</h3><ul>\n<li>Could be overwhelming to write and overwhelming to read if the format is not clear and ordered</li>\n<li>Takes a long time to build (Careful with the need of the organization to start working fast on security measures)</li>\n<li>Could take long time to read (Again careful with formats, if someone needs/wants to read just 5% of the report help her/him to reach quickly and effectively to that 5%)</li>\n<li>This format requires running the threat modelling activities from SAFETAG (Which in my opinion should be the norm, but it could affect your freedom selecting the activities)</li>\n</ul></section></section>\n<section><h2 id=\"5-the-awesome-format-that-you-use-and-we-dont-know-yet\">5: The awesome format that you use and we don't know... yet</h2><p>Understanding that there is no silver bullet for reporting security\nassessments for NGOs and independent media outlets, we can open the\ndiscussion about many other ways to present the information we gather\nduring our assessments. If you know and/or use another approach and want\nto share it with this community, don't doubt to</p></section>\n<section><h2 id=\"conclusions\">Conclusions</h2><p>With all of this options and the potential combinations and variations\nof them, it's virtually impossible to not have one kind of report that\nadapts well to our needs in each case. In our case, we usually aim for\nthe long report in point 4 given that the information gathered for it\nallows us to rewrite the report to be more like the simpler versions\ndescribed above. The more experience you have as an auditor, the faster\nyou will become at identifying what type of report the organization will\nbe able to understand the best, even if you yourself are still\nconceptualizing and seeking out the answers as if you were building the\nmost comprehensive report. For instance: if the organization explicitly\nwants something short, they are in a bad moment in terms of security and\nthey need to implement fast, we want to give a detailed report for\nIT/Management and another shorter for the Directors or for some external\ntechnical service provider; we already have everything we need. Once\nagain, is up to you (mostly) what kind of report do you want to build\nand what kind of report the organization you attend needs, just remember\nthat <em>our ultimate goal is that they understand how secure they are and\nimplement measures to improve their security and do a better job</em></p></section>","frontmatter":{"title":"The challenges of reporting: Reporting Styles","author":"Carlos Guerra, Mario Felaco","date":"2018-11-20T15:12:00.000Z","tags":["Reporting"],"main_image":null,"main_image_caption":null,"draft":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2018-11-20-challenges-of-reporting-2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
