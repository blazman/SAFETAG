Malware like a Remote Access Trojan (or RAT) can provide an attacker with backdoor access to a targeted machine, enabling the attacker to steal information, record audio and video, as well as run commands on the infected machine.</p>\n<p>To stop this from happening, you have to identify the malicious process within the system and stop it, or reformatting the machine in case you don’t feel spending time on stopping the malicious process.</p>\n<p>It’s important to keep evidence, in case the auditee still has access to the original malicious software they received (e.g., an email, etc.), keep a copy of the file if you have the time and expertise to continue investigating or have the resources to submit it to other organizations working on analyzing such issues.</p>\n<p>Scanning the possible infected machine or the original suspicious file with an anti-virus will save you time and effort, in the case such malware is already in its database. Scanning should always be the first step, preventing you from spending excess time if the machine was infected with a less serious piece of malware.</p>\n<p>After determining the machine is infected, you can proceed in helping the staff member back up their information, scanning the files for malware, then reformatting the infected machine. Note, it is very difficult to clean an infected machine if you only have a short window of time.</p>\n<p>In case the machine was infected, taking an image of the operating system will allow you to replicate the infected machine and run it after you finish your audit for a more in-depth investigation or send it to an expert to work on investigating the malware. Note, this also can be difficult in an audit setting where time is limited. Also see operational security considerations that come with replicating the files of a staff member of a sensitive organization.

The auditor will not have much time for this step, but a preliminary analysis (not longer than one hour) can be performed, following these instructions:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Step 1: Collection</strong></li>\n<li>Collect the binary from the targeted person or organization by asking them to forward you the suspicious email including any attachment in it, or by coping the file if it’s still on the machine by copying it to a USB drive. In case the user did not remember where the file is located, ask the user to walk through their browsing history or download folder and try to locate the file and then copy it to your USB drive.</li>\n<li>Get a hash of the file and a timestamp of the file at acquisition</li>\n</ul><p>Include the hashes of the malicious files in the appendix of your assessment report.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Step 2: Research</strong></li>\n<li>\n<p>Initial offline investigation, in this stage you will be scanning the file using <a href=\"https://www.clamav.net/\">ClamAV</a> which comes with Kali-Linux</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update CalmAV by running the following command in the terminal\n<code>sudo freshclam</code></li>\n<li>Create a new folder and copy-paste the suspicious (file)s inside, then scan the targeted folder by running the following command in the terminal which is going to show the infected files and give you more information about it <code>clamscan -r –bell -i /your/target/folder</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Search for the hash on a MISP instance or VirusTotal to check if there are any related events, known malware associations, and connected details (such as URLs, email addresses, IP addresses)</li>\n<li>After scanning the file, in case it has already been identified as malicious, the result will show you what type of malware is, in case the result showed the file as Trojan, Backdoor, agent or Remote access Trojan RAT then it’s time to consider taking an image from the hard drive, the original file, the header of the email and submit them for in depth investigation.</li>\n</ul><p>If the organization was targeted with a more advanced attack, there will be a high probability that the attacker will use new or disguised malware -- which means no Anti-Virus will find it as malicious, in this case, and if you feel you still have doubts that a clean file is still malicious, submit it for in depth analysis.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Step 3 (Optional): Imaging</strong></li>\n</ul><p>In this step, you will be dealing with infected machine by one of the binaries you analyzed in step 1 and 2, or you are sure that the machine is infected and you have no time to analyze it. In this case, you will take a backup, migrate the data safely to a new machine and take a full image from the system and submit it for more in depth analysis.</p><ul>\n<li>\n<p>It’s better to start with taking a full hard disk image, using ‘dd’ a tool that takes bit-by-bit copy of the hard drive, after taking the image, you will have an identical copy of infected machine and you can send the hard drive to experts for more in depth analysis. To take the image, you will need to boot the infected machine with a Live Kali Linux and apply the following steps:</p>\n<pre><code>-   Identify the `&#x3C;source>` which is the infected hard disk, and `&#x3C;destination>` the external hard disk you will put the image on, run the following command which will list all the drive *lsblk*\n\n-   After identifying the source and destination, apply the following command the start the process `dd if=&#x3C;source> of=&#x3C;destination> bs=&#x3C;byte size>`\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Where bs is byte size, read more about how to use dd <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/disk_cloning\">here</a></em></p>\n</li>\n<li>Taking back up in this stage is to back-up all the important data and save them on a hard drive, usually it’s the document, desktop, download, favorite and personal data, save them on external storage then Scan them using <a href=\"https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/clamav-ubuntu/\">ClamAV</a> or any available Anti-virus on your auditing virtual machine.</li>\n<li>Make sure the data is clean then transfer it to the clean replacement machine.</li>\n<li><strong>Step 4 (Optional): Analysis</strong></li>\n</ul><p><em>See the <a href=\"https://safetag.org/activities/incident_response\">Incident Response Activity</a> for additional details.</em></p><p>You will need at least one hour to prepare and carry the advanced investigation. this step is optional in case you have time and you think you still have doubts about the file and you need a more advanced result.
