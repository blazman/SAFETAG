It should help identify what threats / threat actors they are dealing with, and their intent.  This will help the auditor prioritize work with the organisation during the audit and follow up and understand whether the auditor has the expertise to address or understand the threat or if outside expertise is needed.</p>"},"walk_through":{"html":"<p><strong>Individual Interview</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Have you encountered suspicious messages, emails, etc. in the course of your work or personal life?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If \"No\" or \"I don't know\", the auditor should give an example of what an suspicious message might look like.</em></li>\n<li><em>If \"yes\", ask these questions for each suspicious event:</em></li>\n<li>Can you tell me about the suspicious message?
