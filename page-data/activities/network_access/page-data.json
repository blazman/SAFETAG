Once an organization is using vulnerable authentication method, you can flag it right away as \"finding\". Given that the recommendations are often the same (move to WPA2 (and WPA3 as available), disable WEP and WPS access, provide a separate guest network, etc.), this should rarely be used during an audit (but is a useful skill to practice and understand how it works). If you do choose to use this during an audit, be aware that many of the stps disrupt network traffic, and success with WPA2 password cracking is by no means guaranteed, so can backfire.</p>\n<p>By walking organizations through the vulnerabilities of wireless networks, you have the opportunity to discuss password strength, and the power that having \"offline\" access to a password means in terms of brute forcing it, as well as the importance of defense in depth even within their trusted work network - reducing the services computers and servers are sharing, setting up local firewalls on computers, and requiring authentication to access files.</p>\n<p>Even a few minutes of network \"sniffing\" by an adversary can enable them to work offline to reveal the network password.  Knowing this password would let someone then access the entire internal network, files shared internally, and even change network settings to enable remote access.  While in an ideal setup, this would give no further access to sensitive documents, it is not uncommon to find shared file folders, or to gain access to the firewall or network routers (often set to the default password, because they're only accessible from inside the network...).</p>"},"materials_needed":null,"considerations":{"html":"<p><em>Note:</em> This section is one of the few sections where the SAFETAG audit does go through attack scenarios, from attempting to \"break in\" to the wireless network to testing exposed ethernet jacks for connectivity.</p>\n<p>The reasons for this are threefold.

This is an important security measure, and a WPA-protected wireless network is much safer than an unencrypted “open” network or a WEP-protected network. (WEP is fundamentally flawed, and extremely simple attacks have been widely known for over a decade.) However, the ease with an attacker could guess the WPA key, or “WiFi password,” is a serious issue, particularly considering its importance as an essential perimeter control. An attacker who gains access to the wireless LAN immediately bypasses many protections that network administrators, and other users of the office network, often take for granted. Put another way, anyone able to guess the WPA key is immediately “inside the firewall.”</p><p>Using a laptop and a wireless card with a standard, internal antenna (or using a customized smartphone or other small device), an attacker could easily position themselves close enough to the office to carry out the first phase of this attack, which would only take a few minutes. The second phase, which is supposed to be the difficult part, could take even less time. From the privacy of their own home or office, the attacker could use a minimally customized password dictionary to guess the WPA key .</p><!--For reporting, needs time-to-break WPA password --><p><strong>Materials Needed</strong></p><ul>\n<li>For the (most common) WPA password-based attacks, an already-prepared dictionary of words to use to attack the password will be required.

The attacker may then add hundreds or thousands of words (in English and/or other relevant languages).</p><p>See the <a href=\"https://safetag.org/activities/password_strength\">Password Strength Activity</a> for details on password dictionary building and usage.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The attacker would then begin recording all (encrypted) wireless traffic associated with the organization’s access point:</p><pre><code>$ sudo airodump-ng -c 1 --bssid 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F -w sampleorg_airodump mon0\n\n CH  1 ][ Elapsed: 12 mins ][ 2012-01-23 12:34 ][ fixed channel mon0: -1\n BSSID              PWR RXQ  Beacons    #Data, #/s  CH  MB   ENC  CIPHER AUTH ESSID\n 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F  -70 100    12345    43210    6   1  12e.

Try using different clients if the first one doesn't work, or try (physically) moving around.</p><p>This handshake does not contain the WPA key itself, but once the the complete handshake process has been seen, the auditor (or a potential attacker) can leave the vicinity and run various password cracking tools to try and discover the password. While a complete password cracking tutorial is out of scope for SAFETAG documentation, below are three strategies:</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The auditor attempts to discover the WPA password.</p><p>A good wordlist with a few tweaks tends to break an unforunate number of passwords.

That rate of approximately 2000 keys per second means that a full-on, brute-force attack against a similar-length key that was truly random (and therefore immune to dictionary-based attacks) would take about 70^9 or 20 trillion seconds, which is well over 600,000 years. Or, for those who favor length and simplicity over brevity and complexity, a key containing four words chosen from among the 10,000 most common English dictionary words would still take approximately 150,000 years to crack (using this method on an average laptop).</p><p>It is worth noting that an attacker with the resources and the expertise could increase this rate by a factor of a hundred. Using a computer with powerful graphical processing units (GPUs) or a cloud computing service like Amazon’s EC2, it is possible to test 250,000 or more keys per second. A setup like this would still take several lifetimes to guess a strong password, however.</p><p>Regardless, the success of this attack against a wireless network would allow an attacker to bypass all perimeter controls, including the network firewall. Without access to the office LAN, a non-ISP, non-government attacker would have to position themselves on the same network as an external staff member in order to exploit any flaws in the organization’s email or file-sharing services. With access to the local network, however, that attacker could begin carrying out local attacks quite quickly, and from a distance.</p><p>See the <a href=\"https://safetag.org/activities/wireless_range_mapping\">Wireless Range Mapping Activity</a> for guidance on mapping the reach of the Wi-Fi network.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><ul>\n<li><em>Tutorial:</em> <a href=\"http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=cracking_wpa\">“How to Crack WPA/WPA2”</a> (Aircrack-ng Wiki)\n<a href=\"http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=aircrack-ng\">“Aircrack-ng”</a> (Aircrack-ng Wiki)</li>\n<li><em>Documentation:</em> <a href=\"http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=aireplay-ng\">“Aireplay-ng”</a> (Aircrack-ng Wiki)</li>\n<li><em>Documentation:</em> <a href=\"http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airodump-ng\">“Airodump-ng”</a> (Aircrack-ng Wiki)</li>\n</ul><hr></section>\n<section><h6 id=\"variant-wps-pin-cracking\">Variant: WPS PIN Cracking</h6><p>WPS was built as an addition to WPA to make it easier to add devices without typing in secure passwords, but this ease of use means that a malicious actor can pose as a device and effectively reduce the potentially very difficult passwords WPA allows down to a simple numeric-only 8 character PIN.
