It is useful for organizations with offices in shared spaces/buildings/apartment complexes or near locations where an adversary could easily \"listen\" to network traffic. In conjuction with Monitoring Open Wireless Traffic exercise, it can also identify devices using that network. It is useful to do this in parallel with Office Mapping to build a more comprehensive view of the information assets of the organization.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify and verify the network(s) belonging to the organization</li>\n<li>Create a map or photos indicating the range of each relevant wireless access point.</li>\n</ul>"},"materials_needed":{"html":"<ul>\n<li>A portable wireless device (like an Android phone/tablet) is useful to map the network boundaries without causing undue suspicion.

Wireless networks are often trusted as equivalent to the hardwired office networks they have largely replaced, but they have important differences. Wireless networks are often \"visible\" from outside the walls of the office - from common spaces or even the street. Without further access, this reveals a wealth of information about the organization's size and the type of devices connecting to their network.</p>"},"walk_through":{"html":"<p>Map the range of the organizations wireless network outside of office space, using wifite or other tools to track network strength.</p>\n<p>A variety of apps and tools can support this work without resorting to professional \"wifi site survey\" tools. If the Office Mapping exercise has taken place, that map can serve as the starting point to expand the map outside the office. If using a third party tool or app, ensure that the app is not sharing sensitive data.  Using simple signal strength monitors in combination with location notes is more than sufficient. In Linux systems, one can use wavemon, kismet, wifite, and even the networkmanager command line tools to track visible networks and their strengths <a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/237777/is-there-a-tool-like-wifi-analyzer-for-ubuntu\">as described on StackExchange</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>watch  \"nmcli -f \"CHAN,BARS,SIGNAL,SSID\" d wifi list ifname wlx10feed21ae1d  | sort -n\"\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netspotapp.com/\">https://www.netspotapp.com/</a> (OSX, Windows, free for non-commercial uses)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wifianalyzer.mobi\">http://wifianalyzer.mobi</a>,  <a href=\"http://wifiheat.com/\">http://wifiheat.com/</a> (Android)</li>\n</ul>"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/activities/wireless_range_mapping"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
