AUDITOR will make every effort to avoid disrupting SUBJECT's work environment, even temporarily. No tests will be performed that would stress the network, or any individual workstation, beyond what could be expected from normal use. If they have any doubt, AUDITOR will consult with SUBJECT before carrying out the test.</li>\n<li>AUDITOR will not share the assessment report—or any notes created, data gathered or knowledge obtained about SUBJECT during the evaluation—with anyone other than a single point of contact, designated by SUBJECT. AUDITOR may need to share some general information with SUBJECT staff, as part of requesting information necessary to carry out the audit itself. If AUDITOR has any concern that this could be sensitive, they will first clear it with the point of contact. This commitment to protecting SUBJECT's private information extends to AUDITOR’s colleagues, supervisor and funder. The only details about the assessment that will be shared, confidentially, with these three groups (and only these three groups) will include: a) the name and location of the organization audited; b) basic time line information; and, with SUBJECT's approval, anonymized “lessons learned”. During and after the audit itself, all data will be stored securely in an encrypted volume on AUDITOR’s computer.</li>\n<li>AUDITOR will securely delete all data from the audit one year after submitting the final assessment report to SUBJECT or at any time, should SUBJECT's point of contact request it.</li>\n<li>AUDITOR will work with whatever level of access SUBJECT is comfortable providing. This includes access to staff members for brief \"interviews,\" as well as more technical access, such as passwords, local connectivity, privileged or unprivileged accounts on local or remote services, etc.. That said, some level of access typically allows an auditor to produce a report that is significantly more useful than the output of a pure \"black box\" audit. (And this is doubly true when the auditor wishes to tread lightly in order to avoid impacting the stability of the subject’s network infrastructure and the productivity of its staff.)</li>\n</ul></section>"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/activities/confidentiality_agreement"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
